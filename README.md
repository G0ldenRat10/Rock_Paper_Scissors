# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is my first written program for Frontend Web Development,
and is usually not something im into but I would love to share it here to follow with future progress.
UPDATE: Will use it as project part of the exam material.
UPDATE: Ended up taking a route from classic rock, paper, scissors game ,
to a hidden CTF, that a player will need to find.
